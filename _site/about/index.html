<p itemprop="description">The Tanzanian Government committed to the Open
Government Partnership. It promises to release datasets as Open Data.
'Where is the Data?' collects requests for datasets and tracks them.</p>
<p>Governments like to make promises and committing to programs that make
them look good. The Open Government Partnership is one of the programs
where it is easy to get the good lable without actually delivering anything
along the ideas of it. It is important to hold government accountable for
what it promises. Publicly tracking promises, deliverance and responses is
one way to do this. 'Where is the Data?' tracks requests for open data to
give the government a sense of what is wanted and to show where the
government fails to deliver data</p>
<p>'Where is the Data?' was conceived and created by <a
href="http://tentacleriot.eu" itemprop="creator">Michael Bauer</a>. It is
built on github/jekyll/bootstrap/recline and google docs.</p>
